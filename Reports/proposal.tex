\begin{abstract}
    In the contemporary film industry, accurately predicting a movie's earnings is paramount for maximizing profitability. This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting movie earnings based on input features like budget, director, genre, leading crew, and IMDb ratings. Through a structured methodology involving data collection, preprocessing, analysis, model selection, evaluation, and improvement, a robust predictive model is constructed. Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest Regression have been tested . Model improvement strategies include hyperparameter tuning and feature selection. The resulting model offers promising accuracy and generalization, facilitating informed decision-making in the film industry to maximize profits.

    \subsection{Motivation}
        Imagine you are a filmmaker or head of a movie production house and you have a big question: what makes a movie a blockbuster hit or a flop?
        
        You might think it depends on the star power of the actors, the vision of the director, the budget of the production, or the genre of the story.
        
        Or you might think it is simply the quality of the storytelling that captivates the audience and earns high ratings.
        But the answer is not straightforward or easy.
        
        There are many factors that influence the earnings of a movie, and the true combination of these factors has not been mastered yet.
        
        Thatâ€™s why we have developed a machine learning model that reveals the most important factors for box office success by analyzing real data from a wide variety of movies produced around the world.
        With our model, filmmakers can make more informed decisions and optimize their movie production for maximum profit and popularity.

    \subsection{Rationale}
        We hypothesize that certain parameters hold more significance in predicting movie revenue than others. Specifically, we conjecture that the director's track record and the genre of the film carry substantial weight in this prediction model.
        
        Our observations suggest that despite lower IMDb ratings, action-oriented films often demonstrate strong performance at the box office. Conversely, genres such as comedy or emotional dramas, despite potentially higher IMDb ratings, may not achieve comparable revenue outcomes to their action counterparts. 
        
        These insights underscore the complex interplay between film attributes and audience preferences, prompting us to assign greater importance to factors like directorial history and genre classification within our predictive framework.

    \subsection{Overview}
        
    We followed a structured approach to build and evaluate a movie revenue prediction model.
    
    Initially, we collected and tailored a large movie dataset. Next, we preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
    
    Data analysis using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and data visualization helped us understand the data and relationships between features.
    
    We then selected and tested suitable regression algorithms like decision trees and random forests using cross-validation and evaluation metrics like R-squared mean error.
    
    Finally, we employed model improvement strategies like hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and regularization to enhance accuracy and generalization.
    
    The resulting model offers promising results for predicting movie revenue based on its features.

    \subsection{Data Analysis}
    In the data analysis phase, we will thoroughly examine the collected movie dataset to gain insights into its structure, distribution, and relationships between features and the target variable (movie earnings). We dropped the unnecessary extra parameters and have come down to 5 parameters, which are the director's name, actor 1's name, actor 2's name, genre and budget.
